Arrows: Directed edges to show signal flow between brain regions.
Color-coded Connections:
Blue: Intact connections.
Red: Damaged connections due to Alzheimer's.
Labels for Brain Regions: Clear positioning of node labels for better understanding.
Improved Layout: Realistic and organized node placements to resemble anatomical relationships.
Run the updated program, and you'll have a much clearer, more detailed depiction of Alzheimer's neural circuitry! Let me know if further customization is needed.
